Rather than focusing on anything specific this week, as a starting point, I thought it might be helpful to provide a quick overview on the achievements of my 6 months in office so far.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Introduced a new leading student body for sport called the Student Sport Senate containing the student heads of all 7 sporting programmes (Performance, AU, IMS, Coach and Volunteer Academy, My Lifestyle, Society and Departmental Sport). This group offers a body to represent the student voice across the whole pathway of sport at Loughborough.
	</li>
	<li>
		Balanced the AU’s budget. After overspending by 24k last year we are back within budget.
	</li>
	<li>
		Secured £5000 worth of funding from Venue to be used in the form of grants to clubs while encouraging social club activity in the Union building.
	</li>
	<li>
		Introduced and piloted the Alumni and Supporters Club Fund, based on Alumni, or other externals, donating £1 a month (£12 a year) back to individual clubs. If each of our 57 clubs managed to sign up just 20 individuals a year to contribute in this manner, inside 3 years it would raise more than the total grant amount currently given to clubs from the Athletic Union and in the long term (30 years)would bring in over £400,000 a year.
	</li>
	<li>
		Created a sponsorship package for clubs to be distributed shortly and introduced the request for funds form, giving clubs the opportunity to detail important projects and push them to the Universities fund raising team for additional support.
	</li>
	<li>
		Remodelled Club Committee training with the help of student working groups to discover exactly when committee members felt training should be delivered and what should be taught. This has helped us to create a structure of sustainable delivery to repeat on a yearly basis that will help us to ensure our committees are in the best place to carry out their required roles.
	</li>
	<li>
		Looked into tackling unsuitable initiations within clubs with the Red Card campaign at the start of the year. In the coming weeks we will be hosting a workshop delivered to a number of clubs focusing on how to make initiations a positive, team bonding experience for clubs rather than the uncomfortable scenarios they are often notorious for. Also worked with student services to write an anti-social behaviour policy to be implemented shortly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Introduced the Athletic Union Executive buddy programme, partnering members of the Athletic Union Executive up to different AU Clubs. This has really helped us to engage clubs better, given clubs another communication channel to highlight issues and enabled us to pinpoint areas within clubs for us to offer increased support.
	</li>
	<li>
		After a huge promotional effort we hosted the first ever Stadium sell out event as our Rugby Union team took on Queensland.
	</li>
	<li>
		Following a successful AU Bazaar and high recruitment drive this year we have seen the highest number of AU Members ever.
	</li>
	<li>
		Implemented a buddy/mentor programme between the AU Exec and staff from the Universities sport team (SDC) to link the AU and SDC closer together and help with their progression as part of our focus on student development this year.
	</li>
	<li>
		Introduced showcase fixtures and the supporters club fb page to publicise more AU activity. And give publicity to a wider range of Athletic Union Clubs.
	</li>
	<li>
		Made huge progression with the important subject of data collection. Card scanners should be in facilities for a piloting period early next term. This project will enable us to better understand facility usage and help us make strategic decisions to maximise student experience.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pushed for the introduction of a second sport sabbatical with the paper “The growing remit of Student Sport”. Although the sabbatical concept was halted by the University further discussions were had and I remain confident that an internship will be created to help give clubs greater support and enable the VP Sport to take a strategic view on the sporting landscape by next year.
	</li>
	<li>
		Secured two TV screens in the Union facility, one in JCs bar and one outside the Student Sport Office, which can be used to help promote sporting activity and clubs as content is created.
	</li>
	<li>
		Event managed Durham Day, which saw a large number of students engage with spectatorship, particularly for the Men’s and Women’s Lacrosse and hockey fixtures.
	</li>
	<li>
		Created two new positions on the Athletic Union Executive, an Alumni Rep and a Media: Graphic Design, as well as two Spectatorship assistants and a further media assistant, to ensure our team has the required skills to tackle the challenges that arise, and the capacity to offer support to clubs when needed.
	</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
The above showcase the projects undertaken so far, alongside the hugely important tasks of managing the AU, and supporting clubs and students. I appreciated there is a huge amount more to do but my two main focuses for the second half of the year are to push and promote the Alumni and Supporters Club Fund, and to write an Athletic Union strategy which will help us reassess what are our priorities, guide the direction of the AU and subsequent VP Sports over the mid to long term, and enable us to focus support and resource in a more structured and analysed manner.
Yours in Sport
Luke
